A terminal- or command line-based script for mimicking the style and vocabulary of a given text.

huge thanks to advensturesML for:
    https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/rnn/ptb/reader.py
and the TensorFlow tutorial it's adapted from:
    https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/recurrent

Usage (will probably change):
$   cd ./grammar-pyml
$   python general_lm.py "../data/lcw_processed.txt"
    ...
$   python generator.py "lcw_processed"

Eventual flow:
    - Create "general" language model using ptb set or similar, with concatenated collected works of the author being mimicked
    - Starting with trained master "general" model, train again exclusively on collected works of author w/high learning rate and potentially momentum-based descent function, idea being to jump from the minimum the model will presumably start out in to one closer to the author's voice
    - Generate sentences from "seed" sentence either typed by user or chosen at random from collected works
